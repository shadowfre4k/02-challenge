# <HTML Semantics>

## Description

I created this project in order to practice my ability to create a webpage with good accessability. I wanted to make practice my conventions and make sure that i created a legible code base for any reader that would come along and read my code. I learned to make sure that all of of HTML tags are used as signs to be specific and organize my document in a meaningful way.
